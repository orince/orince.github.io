I am currently pursuing a PhD in the Department of Decision Analytics and Operations at City University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof.[Guanhao Feng](https://gavinfeng702.com/) and Prof.[Jingyu He](https://jingyuhe.com/). I received my master's degree in Statistics from the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University in 2021. Before that, I earned double bachelor’s degrees in Statistics and Insurances at Jilin University in 2017.

My research lies at the intersection of empirical asset pricing, textual analysis, and machine learning, with a particular focus on how news and other unstructured information are incorporated into financial markets.
