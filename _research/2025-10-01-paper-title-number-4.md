excerpt: 'We examine how firm news drives trading activity and information asymmetry across equity and corporate bond markets. 
Leveraging generative AI through a Large Language Model (DeepSeek) to extract granular, asset-specific sentiment intensity from Dow Jones Newswires (2002–2023), we establish that sentiment intensity is a robust predictor of abnormal volume. 
A one-standard-deviation increase in news magnitude raises next-day volume shocks by 17\% for bonds and 29\% for equities. We document a significant cross-market asymmetry: bond-specific shocks trigger immediate but transient equity volume, while equity-specific shocks induce persistent activity in the less liquid bond market. 
We rationalize these findings through a multi-asset microstructure framework that provides a structural explanation for the observed asymmetric information flow. 
This study positions LLM-derived sentiment intensity as a novel, text-based measure of market-specific information risk, bridging textual analysis with market microstructure theory.'
