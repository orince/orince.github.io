excerpt: 'This paper introduces the Group Lasso Approach (GL) for variable selection, encompassing two innovative methods: Directed Group Lasso (DGL) and Spectral Group Lasso (SGL). DGL is designed to identify factors that span a linear subspace closely resembling that of all candidate factors. In contrast, SGL begins with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and extends further by incorporating a secondary estimation stage. The variable selection process in SGL utilizes a loss function with an $\ell_2$ to $\ell_\infty$ norm penalty, similar to the traditional group lasso methodology. We demonstrate the consistency of variable selection for both methods under high-dimensional scaling through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the Group Lasso Approach in accurately identifying true factors within complex, high-dimensional datasets.'
